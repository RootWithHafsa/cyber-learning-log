# 🖧 Networking

This folder contains my notes, tools, and practical labs related to computer networking. As part of my cybersecurity learning journey, I'm exploring how networks function at the protocol level, how data is transferred, and how attackers and defenders use network tools.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- OSI & TCP/IP Models
- IP Addressing & Subnetting
- ARP, DNS, DHCP
- TCP vs UDP
- Packet Routing & Switching
- ICMP & Ping
- Port Scanning (nmap, netcat)
- Packet Capture & Analysis (Wireshark, tcpdump)
- Common Network Attacks (MITM, DoS basics)


## 🛠️ Tools & Commands

| Tool        | Use Case                          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| `nmap`      | Port scanning, host discovery     |
| `netcat`    | Banner grabbing, reverse shells   |
| `tcpdump`   | CLI packet capture                |
| `Wireshark` | Graphical packet analysis         |
| `ip`, `ss`  | Network interface and socket info |


## 📌 Why Networking Matters in Cybersecurity

Understanding networking is crucial in cybersecurity because:
- Attackers often exploit weaknesses in network protocols.
- Defenders must analyze and monitor traffic to detect threats.
- Tools like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and SIEMs rely on networking concepts.
