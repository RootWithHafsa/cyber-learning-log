## File Permissions

- `r` = read  
- `w` = write  
- `x` = execute

In the Linux file system, permissions are based on three categories:  
- the **file owner**  
- the **user group**  
- all **other users**

In the example above, the file `crack.txt` is readable and writable by the file owner and user group, but only readable by others.
